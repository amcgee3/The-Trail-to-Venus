# The-Trail-to-Venus
Made during the NASA SpaceApps Hackathon 2021 hosted by Alabama A&amp;M University.

We were tasked with creating a game that mirrors the style of the Oregon Trail. Oregon Trail is famous for its accuracy and brutal depictions of travel along the Oregon Trail. Even though we cannot be as accurate due to the limitations of our knowledge on what is truly out there in space, we were able to emulate the game's style and hopefully create a challenge for our projected audience. 

The minigames are a lot more simple due to the target demographic, but they do require that players be attentive and ready for the situations that randomly pop up. No play-through should be the same, and we hope that our game can be truly enjoyable. However, that does not mean that the game is easy!

Our project was built using the python programming language. We hope to use it to get kids excited about space travel, while providing an engaging text game that emulates the style of the original Oregon trail.  While we did not have much time to add in extra facts about space travel, we did manage to involve quite a few math and trivia questions into our game to stimulate young minds. This game only requires that the player be paying attention and only uses the keyboard to enter the required text. We used replit.com to run our code and test it for bugs. If there are any left we will be happy to fix them as soon as possible.

The game can be played here without any downloads: https://replit.com/@amcgee3/The-Space-Trail#main.py

Note: Although the above link is to replit.com it will take you to a page that will only allow you to see the output. The code will be hosted here on github in case anyone wants to add to it.
